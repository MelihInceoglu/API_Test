# API_Test

"API testing" is a type of testing used to verify the data and processes behind a software application. These tests are designed to retrieve, send, and process data using the application's programming interface (API). API tests are used to ensure that an application is functioning correctly and producing the expected results.

Here is an example of how to perform an API test using Selenium TestNG:

### 1 - Prepare the Environment: The first step is to set up the environment necessary for API testing, including the installation of required libraries such as Selenium and TestNG.

### 2 - Create the Test Scenario: Create a test scenario that defines the purpose of the API test and the expected results. For example, you can test the process of a user logging in through an API.

### 3 - Write the Test Code: Code the API test using Selenium and TestNG. This includes the Selenium actions to implement the test scenario and TestNG assertion steps. For example, you can use Selenium's web driver to send user login information to the API and then verify whether the login was successful.

###  4 - Run the Test: Execute the API test. This involves initiating the test scenario and interacting with the API. You can monitor the test results using TestNG reports.

### 5 - Evaluate the Results: Analyze the results of the API test. You can determine whether the test was successful by reviewing TestNG reports and validation steps.

### 6 - Debug and Improve: If the test fails, debug and improve the code. Ensure that the requests sent to the API and the responses received are correct.

API tests are essential for ensuring the reliability and stability of software. Therefore, running API tests regularly and verifying that the application still functions correctly after changes are critical aspects of the software development process.
